Eden's Garden 

:: Start

Welcome, to the garden of Eden Attar, I am Nede Ratta, the gardener genie. 
I am a narcissistic fragment of Eden's ego, set on a special mission
to cultivate this public space. I'm her brand manager...

**The genie speaks monotonously:** Eden Attar was born on... Oh! She's actually here right now, just ask her to tell you. This narcissistic genie needs a smoking break. 

(link-reveal: "Smoking PSA")[: It is completely okay for genies to smoke. I mean, they are after all like 99% made of smoke. If you are a human with lungs, you should probably not smoke, unless that is really the way you want to die.]

Hi! I'm Eden Attar! I am a graduate student in musicology at Washington University in Saint Louis, where I am writing my masters' thesis on *Sesame Street* and the forms of listening it teaches. While I am in the musicology department, I really consider myself a *media ecologist,* that is, I study media as an interconnected web of communicating, competing, and symbiotic entities akin to the way that an ecologist would study a section of forest. You can read all about it in my draft available [[on github.|draft]] You can see more of my musicological work in my [[cabinet of curiosities|Cabinet]]

My research on *Sesame Street* is closely related to my practice as a *network artist.* Network art is the design and curation of aesthetically pleasing computer networks or other infrastructures. One of my favorite examples of network art is Roel Roscam Abbing's *Messing Around With Packet Radio.* If you found yourself here, I can imagine you would love his site: https://test.roelof.info/

I am also a musician, composer, and improviser. At the moment I mostly play harpsichord, sing, and experiment with synthesizers. When I lived in Chicago I lead the group Meadowlarke. I maintain the old website for old time's sake, and its a little broken at the moment, so [[hold on to your hats 'cause it's a wild ride!|meadowlarke]]

:: Yet

*Yet* is an explorable archive and text based adventure that I made for a class session that I taught when TAing at WASHU. It contains resources pertaining to Janelle Monáe and Sun Ra. "Yet" is a reference to the song "The Power of Yet" which Monáe performed on *Sesame Street,* which I find to be a powerful statement of the ethos of Afrofuturism.

When I first arrived at the program at WASHU I was really frustrated that musicology papers didn't have embedded audio, so I started writing my musicology papers as html webpages.

:: House

Some time during the pandemic, living alone in a now town, I started missing the domesticity (click-replace: "domesticity")[queer domesticity] that I had in Chicago and decided that I never wanted to live alone again. I started sketching various dream houses that I could build so that my friends could come live with me. While I was making these sketches I realized that architectural projections are almost entirely visual, though we experience architecture narratively---that is, we enter a building for a reason, choose a linear path through it, and then leave. This means that our experience has a beginning, a middle, and an end. 



This got me thinking about making text-based architectural projections that are only narrative and completely non-visual. I started building a house in a MUSH, a multi-user text based world that had its heyday in the 80s, but online MUSH communities are still going strong. It still has a long way to go before its done, but feel free to visit the *House of Attar.* You will need a MUSH client, I like tinyfugue.
